class MidiListener(threading.Thread):
    """
    Self-contained midi listener thread.

    This object allows to setup a Midi server that is independent
    of the audio server (mainly to be able to receive Midi data even
    when the audio server is stopped). Although it runs in a separated
    thread, the same device can't be used by this object and the audio
    server at the same time. It is adviced to call the deactivateMidi()
    method on the audio server to avoid conflicts.

    :Parent: threading.Thread

    :Args:

        function : Python function (can't be a list)
            Function that will be called when a new midi event is available.
            This function is called with the incoming midi data as
            arguments. The signature of the function must be:

            def myfunc(status, data1, data2)

        mididev : int, optional
            Sets the midi input device (see `pm_list_devices()` for the
            available devices). The default, -1, means the system default
            device. A number greater than the highest portmidi device index
            will open all available input devices.

    .. note::

        This object is available only if pyo is built with portmidi support
        (see withPortmidi function).
