"""
03-fuzz-disto.py - Hand-written asymmetrical tranfert function.

This example implements a fuzz distortion. Bandpass filtered signal is
eavily boosted, then feeded to an asymmetrical transfert function, and
finally lowpass filtered to smooth out the sound. Balance between the
dry and the distorted sound is applied before sending the signal to the 
outputs.
