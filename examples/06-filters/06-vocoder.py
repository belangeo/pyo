06-vocoder.py - Analysis/resynthesis vocoder effect.

A vocoder is an analysis/resynthesis process that
uses the spectral envelope of a first sound to shape
the spectrum of a second sound. Usually (for the best
results) the first sound should present a dynamic
spectrum (both frequencies and amplitudes) and the
second sound should contain a rich and stable spectrum.

In this example, LFOs are applied to every dynamic argument
of the Vocoder object to show the range of sound effects
the user can get with a vocoder.
