02-bandpass-filters.py - Narrowing a bandpass filter bandwidth.

This example illustrates the difference between a simple IIR second-order
bandpass filter and a cascade of second-order bandpass filters. A cascade
of four bandpass filters with a high Q can be used as a efficient resonator
on the signal.
