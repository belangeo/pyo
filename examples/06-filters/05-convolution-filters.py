05-convolution-filters.py - Circular convolution.

A circular convolution is defined as the integral of the
product of two functions after one is reversed and shifted.

Circular convolution allows to implement very complex FIR
filters, at a CPU cost that is related to the filter impulse
response (kernel) length.

Within pyo, there is a family of IR* filter objects using
circular convolution with predefined kernel:

- IRAverage : moving average filter
- IRFM : FM-like filter
- IRPulse : comb-like filter
- RWinSinc : break wall filters (lp, hp, hp, br)

For general circular convolution, use the Convolve object
with a PyoTableObject as the kernel, as in this example:

A white noise is filtered by four impulses taken from the
input mic. Call r1.play(), r2.play(), r3.play() or r4.play()
in the Interpreter field while making some noise in the mic
to fill the impulse response tables. The slider handles the
morphing between the four kernels.

Call t1.view(), t2.view(), t3.view() or t4.view() to view
impulse response tables.

Because circular convolution is very expensive, TLEN (in
samples) should be keep small.
