"""
03-fm-generators.py - Frequency modulation synthesis.

There two objects in the library that implement frequency
modulation algorithms. These objects are very simple, although
powerful. It is also relatively simple to build a custom FM
algorithm, this will be covered in the tutorials on custom
synthesis algorithms.

Use the "voice" slider of the window "Input interpolator" to
interpolate between the two sources. Use the controller windows
to change the parameters of the FM algorithms.

Note what happened in the controller window when we give a
list of floats to an object's argument.
