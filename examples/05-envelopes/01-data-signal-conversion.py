01-data-signal-conversion.py - Conversion from number to audio stream.

The Stream object is a new type introduced by pyo to represent an
audio signal as a vector of floats. It is sometimes useful to be
able to convert simple numbers (python's floats or integers) to
audio signal or to extract numbers from an audio stream.

The Sig object converts a number to an audio stream.

The PyoObject.get() method extracts a float from an audio stream.
