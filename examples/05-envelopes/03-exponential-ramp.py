03-exponential-ramp.py - Exponential portamento with rising and falling times.

The Port object is designed to lowpass filter an audio signal with
different coefficients for rising and falling signals. A lowpass
filter is a good and efficient way of creating an exponential ramp
from a signal containing abrupt changes. The rising and falling
coefficients are controlled in seconds.
