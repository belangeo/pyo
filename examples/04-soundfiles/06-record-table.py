"""
06-record-table.py - Recording live sound in RAM.

By recording a stream of sound in RAM, one can quickly re-use the
samples in the current process. A combination NewTable - TableRec
is all what one need to record any stream in a table.

The NewTable object has a `feedback` argument, allowing overdub.

The TableRec object starts a new recording (records until the table
is full) every time its method `play()` is called.
