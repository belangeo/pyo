"""
05-math-ops.py - Audio objects and arithmetic expresssions.

This script shows how a PyoObject reacts when used inside an
arithmetic expression.

Multiplication, addition, division and substraction can be applied
between pyo objects or between pyo objects and numbers. Doing so
returns a Dummy object that outputs the result of the operation.

A Dummy object is only a place holder to keep track of arithmetic
operations on audio objects.

PyoObject can also be used in expression with the exponent (**),
modulo (%) and unary negative (-) operators.
