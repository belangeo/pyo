# Pyo - Python DSP module #

pyo is a Python module written in C to help digital signal processing script 
creation.

pyo is a Python module containing classes for a wide variety of audio signal 
processing types. With pyo, user will be able to include signal processing 
chains directly in Python scripts or projects, and to manipulate them in real 
time through the interpreter. Tools in pyo module offer primitives, like 
mathematical operations on audio signal, basic signal processing (filters, 
delays, synthesis generators, etc.), but also complex algorithms to create 
sound granulation and others creative audio manipulations. pyo supports OSC 
protocol (Open Sound Control), to ease communications between softwares, and 
MIDI protocol, for generating sound events and controlling process parameters. 
pyo allows creation of sophisticated signal processing chains with all the 
benefits of a mature, and widely used, general programming language.

Systems : macOS (10.6 -> 10.12), linux, Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10)

Python versions : 2.7.x (stable), 3.x.x (still experimental but fully functional)

## Radio Pyo ##

If you want to listen to scripts rendered in real-time, just connect to 
[Radio Pyo](http://radiopyo.acaia.ca/) !

You want to have your script played on the radio ? Follow the instructions on this

## Softwares using pyo as audio engine ##

[Zyne](https://github.com/belangeo/zyne) : A modular soft synthesizer.

[Soundgrain](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/soundgrain/) : 
A graphical interface where users can draw and edit trajectories to control 
granular sound synthesis.

[Cecilia 5](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/cecilia/) : An audio signal 
processing environment.

[PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/) : An open-source application to allow the 
presentation of stimuli and collection of data for a wide range of neuroscience, 
psychology and psychophysics experiments.

[Pyo Synth](https://github.com/alexandrepoirier/PyoSynth) : Pyo Synth is an open
source application that makes the manipulation of pyo scripts easier by letting
you control it with a midi keyboard. 

## Examples ##

pyo is fully integrated to Python and very simple to use.

Play a sound:

```
>>> from pyo import *
>>> s = Server().boot()
>>> s.start()
>>> sf = SfPlayer("path/to/your/sound.aif", speed=1, loop=True).out()
```

Granulate an audio buffer:

```
>>> s = Server().boot()
>>> s.start()
>>> snd = SndTable("path/to/your/sound.aif")
>>> env = HannTable()
>>> pos = Phasor(freq=snd.getRate()*.25, mul=snd.getSize())
>>> dur = Noise(mul=.001, add=.1)
>>> g = Granulator(snd, env, [1, 1.001], pos, dur, 24, mul=.1).out()
```

Generate melodies:

```
>>> s = Server().boot()
>>> s.start()
>>> wav = SquareTable()
>>> env = CosTable([(0,0), (100,1), (500,.3), (8191,0)])
>>> met = Metro(.125, 12).play()
>>> amp = TrigEnv(met, table=env, mul=.1)
>>> pit = TrigXnoiseMidi(met, dist='loopseg', x1=20, scale=1, mrange=(48,84))
>>> out = Osc(table=wav, freq=pit, mul=amp).out()
```

## Donation ##

This project is developed by Olivier BÃ©langer on his free time to provide a 
fully integrated Python dsp module for sound exploration and music composition. 
If you feel this project is useful to you and want to support it and it's 
future development please consider donating money. I only ask for a small 
donation, but of course I appreciate any amount.
